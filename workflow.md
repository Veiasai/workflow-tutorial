# Git workflow tutorial
This document describes the git workflow that should be used when contributing to open source projects on GitHub. It assumes a very basic understanding of git (commits, branches, etc.)

##  Flow

- Step 1 - Fork the assignment repo to your gitHub account

- Step 2 - Cloning the assignment repo

- Step 3 - Working on your assignment

- Step 4 - Pushing your work to gitHub

- Step 5 - Creating a pull request

## Details

- Repository
    - The goal of Git is to manage a project, or a collection of files, to track their changes.Git uses Repository to store this information
- Branch
    - It may be the most important feature in github. 
    - We always make changes in a branch not the master.
    - Like the top picture shows, we use different branches to do different works.

- Tag
    - Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in history as being important. Typically people use this functionality to mark release points (v0.1, and so on). In this section, youâ€™ll learn how to list the available tags, how to create new tags, and what the different types of tags are.
- Issue
    - Issues can be used to keep track of bugs, enhancements, or other requests.
    - Any GitHub user can create an issue in a public repository where issues have not been disabled.
    - You can open a new issue based on code from an existing pull request.
